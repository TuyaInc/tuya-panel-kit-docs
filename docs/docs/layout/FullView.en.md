In addition, a signal strength reminder notification is mounted on `FullView`, which needs to be met by the real device to support signal strength reporting, and the requested signal strength value is less than the threshold obtained by the cloud interface (-75), a pop-up reminder (as shown in the figure above).

App is version 3.17 and above (that is, get appRnVersion >= '5.24' through TYSdk.mobile.mobileInfo),
The pop-up details page contains an entry to re-check the network signal,If the app version is lower than 3.17, there is no jump entry on the popup details page.

- The device picture in the pop-up box is pulled from the cloud, if the pull fails, it will not be displayed;
- The Wi-Fi offline copy can be configured by the product manager. When the copy exceeds 4, the "More Help" button will appear, otherwise, no more help button will appear;
- Click "More Help", it will jump to the second page: help page, the first time you enter, there will be loading
